Description :

TOM IS GAY

worked with : 
	
	a pen and paper for the matrix thinking

used websites : stackoverflow for some insight into dict

specail comments:
	
	for the check function i chose the change_matrix_for_diagonal because it
	was the most complex and interesting one i made.
	even though it is not immediatly in find_words_in_matrix, it is called
	from many of the functions in find_words_in_matrix.
	
	tests:
		test 1:
			input matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
			expected matrix = [[3], [2, 6], [1, 5], [4]]
			the first test is an OK test, just to see that in a basic scenario
			the function acts accordingly.
			
			the function worked well.
		
		test 2:
			input matrix = [[]]
			expected matrix = [[]]
			in this test i wanted to see if an empty matrix, when turned
			diagonally, will stay empty.
			
			apperantly my function returned the matrix [], which in fact isn't
			a matrix but a list, so i made the neccesarry changes in my code
			so it would return an empty string in this case.
		
		test 3:
			input matrix = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]
			expected matrix = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]
			when inputing a matrix with only one column in each row going over
			it diagonally will produce the same matrix.
			
			the function worked well.
		
		test 4:
			input matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]
			expected matrix = [[7], [6], [5], [4], [3], [2], [1]]
			when inputing a matrix with only one row, the diagonal matrix
			should be the same as the previous test only reversed, because my
			function starts from the top left of the matrix.
			
			and it really does return the same matrix reversed.
		
		test 5:
			input matrix = [["a", "b", 3], [43, "re", True], ["tup", "is", 0]]
			expected matrix = [[3], ['b', True], ['a', 're', 0], [43, 'is'] 
																	,['tup']]
			a test to see if given a matrix where the words in it are more
			then one char, numbers, boolean expressions and mix them all
			together will it still work.
			
			it worked great.
			
			
	*** extra special comment:
		in the check args functions i called the constant ERROR_MESSAGE.
		this constants only purpse is to notify the user what he did wrong in
		the parameters input.
		i wanted to be able to use that varriable instead of passing every
		check function with it, so i change it in the function.
		i am aware that usually this is a bad idea but to me it seems that
		here speciffically it is an okay way to use that.
		just wanted to write this here to get it out of the way.
